        <h3>About DOM(Document object module)</h3>
        <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language.
            <br />
    
            The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.
            <br />
    
            Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
